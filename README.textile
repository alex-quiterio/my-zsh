h1. THE WAY TO WORK AS CHUCK NORRIS

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, the minimum recommended version is 4.3.9.

h3. The automatic installer... (do you trust me?)

You can install this via the command line with either `curl` or `wget`.

h4. via `curl`

@curl -L https://github.com/alex-quiterio/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh@

h4. via `wget`

@wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/alex-quiterio/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh@

h3. The manual way

1. Clone the repository

  @git clone git://github.com/alex-quiterio/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. Create a new zsh config by copying the zsh template we've provided.

  *NOTE*: If you already have a ~/.zshrc file, you should back it up. @cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@ in case you want to go back to your original settings.

  @cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc@

3. Set zsh as your default shell:

  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

4. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough...)
